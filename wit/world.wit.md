This file contains a world that imports all interfaces in this proposal. Its
primary purpose is to allow unified documentation to be easily generated for
the whole proposal.

Proposals should edit replace the import below (and this sentence) with imports
of their own interfaces.

```wit
default world wasi-proposal-template {
    import proposal-interface-name: pkg.proposal-template.proposal-interface-name
}
```
